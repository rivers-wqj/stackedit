> 记录一下托福准备流程


**2024.1.22-2.4**
精神状态远比想象的更加不稳定，并没有像想象中那样用1月份的最后一周把托福考试的计划、材料制定完全。

- 写作：看托福官网的[写作指南](https://www.ets.org/toefl/test-takers/ibt/about/content/writing.html)，网页里还有28个 Writing for an Academic Discussion practice questions 的练习。10分钟的时间确实还比较赶。不过适合我，不用想太多可以张口就来。第一篇练习是4/5。感觉还行，不过估计到5应该很难。
- 听力：主要分为艺术、生命科学、自然科学、社会科学四个板块，所以平时听力设计到的内容会和这些相关。
1.SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN PODCAST **SCIENCE QUICKLY**
这个大概10分钟，生词量不大，内容就是科学相关的，很适合精听。缺点可能就是不是日更，每4天一次。
2.光听科学美国人不太够，尤其是在艺术方面会有所欠缺。就另外再找了一些播客，先放在这。
**The Great Women Artists**
**Dialogues**

**2024.06.25**
明天考试，没想到一月底报名，几乎没有准备。考前一天窝在星巴克抱佛脚。但是又想要报名十一月份的考试了。。。还是等回国再说。不差这一两天。

Secondly, through succeeding construct a similar boat which was made with the same materials and was able to be driven to North America, the writer believes the technology at that time could support the voyage. Nevertheless, the professor points out that it was neither  a copy of the real irish boat nor of the same length of the normal boats in Brendan’s time, which could make the travel impossible.
Thirdly, the reading passage notes old markings resemble letters of old irish alphabet. The speaker, on the other hand, mentions that there were also some pictures among those markers. But irish alphabet does not include any picture, which might just be something  carved by natives.
So, the author and the lecturer hold very different views on the possibility of Brendan’s voyage to North America.

The topic of success or optimism, which is more important generates much discussion since many years ago.
I personally agree with being optimistic and happy when we fail is more important. First of all, most people might just normal and average, which means many people could not have any chance to gain great success. Secondly, the short life of a human being is like an adventure, which me
